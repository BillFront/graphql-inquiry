# GraphQL-Inquiry

A tiny library to generate [GraphQL queries](https://graphql.org/) from Clojure data structures.

Heavily inspired by [Poor manâ€™s GraphQL client for ClojureScript apps](https://medium.com/@kirill.ishanov/poor-mans-graphql-client-for-clojurescript-apps-8dc4b04e8738) by Kirill Ishanov. Thank you very much!

## Philosophy

* Tiny, quick, and consise!
* Just generate the query string, leave the https request to the user.
* Support the 80% of GraphQL that we need in our daily work: queries and mutations, fields including aliases, arguments and variables. If you need more, have a look at [graphql-query](https://github.com/district0x/graphql-query) or [graphql-builder](https://github.com/retro/graphql-builder). Or just write a simple string for that one case?
* Neither try to hide GraphQL nor prevent generating invalid queries. This allows users who understand GraphQL to write really consise queries. The server will validate the query.
* Works with Clojure and ClojureScript

## Usage

```Clojure
(require '[graphql-inquiry.main :as graphql])
```

### Queries

The easiest way to start with graphql-inquiry, is simple's query generation.

```Clojure
(graphql/query [:employee {:id 1
                           :active true} [:name :address :friends [:name :email]]])
=> "{employee (id:1,active:true) {name address friends {name email}}}"
```

Obviously, If we would like to fetch employees and projects within the same simple query, we would do it this way:

```Clojure
(graphql/query [:employee {:id 1
                           :active true} [:name :address :friends [:name :email]]
                :projects {:active true} [:customer :price]])
```

### Field arguments

In the example above, `:employee` and `:projects` fields have arguments `{:id 1 :active true}` and `{:id 1 :active true}` respectively.

We can add arguments to other fields easily by wrapping field name and its arguments to vector `[:customer {:id 2}]`:

```Clojure
(graphql/query [:projects {:active true} [:customer {:id 2} :price]])

=> "{projects (active:true) {customer (id:2) price}}"
```

### Query with alias

If you know how aliases work in GraphQL, you know how to do them in graphql-inquiry:

```Clojure
(graphql/query [:workhorse:employee {:id 1, :active true} [:name :address]
                :boss:employee {:id 2, :active true} [:name :address]])
```

Prettified query:
```graphql
{
  workhorse:employee (id: 1, active: true) {
    name
    address
  }
  boss:employee (id: 2, active: true) {
    name
    address
  }
}
```

This of course works just fine at any level!
```Clojure
(graphql/query [:employee {:id 1, :active true} [:name
                                                 :address
                                                 :mates:friends [:name :email]]])
```
Prettified query:
```graphql
{
  employee (id: 1, active: true) {
    name
    address
    mates:friends {name email}
  }
}
```

### Query with variables

If you want to define variables to the query, you need to pass a map to the `query` function. When using them as parameters, just pass them as a keyword. For example, `:id` will become `$id`.

```Clojure
(graphql/query {:query [:workhorse:employee {:id :id
                                             :active true
                                             :name :name} [:name :address]
                        :boss:employee {:id :id, :active true} [:name :address]]
                :variables {:id :ID!
                            :name :String}})
```
Prettified query:
```graphql
query ($id: ID!, $name: String) {
  workhorse:employee (id: $id, active: true, name: $name) {
    name
    address
  }
  boss:employee (id: $id, active: true) {
    name
    address
  }
}
```

### Mutations

Mutations work just like queries with variables, but instead of `query`, you call `mutation`:

```Clojure
(graphql/mutation {:variables {:id :ID!
                               :project :ProjectInput!}
                   :query [:addProjectToEmployee {:employeeId :id, :project :project} [:allocation :name]]})
```
Prettified query:
```graphql
mutation ($id: ID!, $project: ProjectInput!) {
  addProjectToEmployee (employeeId: $id, project: $project) {
    allocation
    name
  }
}
```

### Meta fields

As you probably expect by now, there is no special syntax for meta fields. Just query them the same as any other field:

```Clojure
(query [:say [:hello :world :__typename]])
```
Prettified query:
```graphql
{
  say {
    hello
    world
    __typename
  }
}
```

## Release a new version

1. First, adjust the `<version>` in the [pom.xml](./pom.xml).
2. Now, run `bin/dclojure -Spom` to update the dependencies.
3. Next, generate the jar with `bin/dclojure -A:pack mach.pack.alpha.skinny --no-libs --project-path graphql-inquiry.jar`
4. Publish the jar on Clojars with `docker-compose run -e CLOJARS_USERNAME=billfront -e CLOJARS_PASSWORD=<token> code clojure -A:deploy`. Get a token from [Clojars dashboard](https://clojars.org/tokens).
